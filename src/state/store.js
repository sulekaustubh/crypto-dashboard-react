// A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.
// Thunk allows us to dispatch actions manually, which gives us the power to incorporate some logic or run some asynchronous code before dispatching an action.
export const store = createStore(reducers,{}, applyMiddleware(thunk))
